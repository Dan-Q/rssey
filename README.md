# RSSey

Based upon hackathon project [Chromiddleware](https://github.com/dan-q/Chromiddleware), this NodeJS web application
acts as a middleware proxy that scrapes web content and spits out machine-readable formats. Its primary purpose is
to expose RSS feeds for websites that don't publish them, so you can use your RSS reader to subscribe to an RSSey
feed, which in turn is configured with JS code/CSS selectors to collate the required data.

Very much "dogfood-under-construction" right now: I'm using it for my own benefit but I can't make any promise
that it's useful for anybody else, yet.
